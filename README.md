This project represents the efforts to learn about c++ in embedded programming, as well as learning how to develop and build embedded projects from the command line. The final goal is to create a low power smartwatch capable of informing the user of incoming notifications, media control, wireless call control and displaying the time.

## Todo List

### Pre prototype learning
- [ ] Learn the basics of C++ (Currently in progress)
- [ ] Learn how to create arduino/esp32 programs throught the command line
    1. [ ] Create a simple arduino program
    1. [ ] Program the arduino
    1. [ ] Repeat the above steps for an esp32
- [ ] Learn how an e-ink display works
    1. [ ] Displaying the time
    2. [ ] Displaying characters in specific places
    3. [ ] Displaying images
    4. [ ] Having multiple screens in the same project
- [ ] Learn how to communicate with a smartphone throught bluetooth
    - [ ] Basic notifications
    - [ ] Answer and hang up calls
    - [ ] Media control
    - [ ] Time sync
- [ ] Integrate a vibrating motor
